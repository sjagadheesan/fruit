# Create README.md for Titanic EDA project

readme_content = """# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the famous Titanic dataset to uncover insights, detect patterns, and prepare the data for further Machine Learning tasks such as survival prediction.

The analysis includes data cleaning, handling missing values, feature understanding, and visualization to explore survival trends.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
- **Files Used:** `train.csv` (primary dataset for analysis)
- **Target Variable:** `Survived` (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived)

---

## 🔍 EDA Steps
1. **Importing Libraries**  
   - Pandas, NumPy for data handling  
   - Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization

2. **Loading the Dataset**  
   - Reading CSV data into a Pandas DataFrame

3. **Data Inspection**  
   - `.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()` for a quick overview

4. **Missing Value Analysis**  
   - Checking missing data with `isnull()` and `sum()`  
   - Handling missing data for columns like `Age`, `Cabin`, and `Embarked`

5. **Feature Analysis**  
   - Categorical Features: `Sex`, `Embarked`, `Pclass`  
   - Numerical Features: `Age`, `Fare`, `SibSp`, `Parch`

6. **Visualizations**  
   - Survival rate by gender and class  
   - Age distribution of passengers  
   - Correlation heatmap for numerical features  
   - Bar plots, histograms, and count plots
